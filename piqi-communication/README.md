Server x clients communication
==============================

Implementation of erlang server which accepts TCP connections from clients (C/C++).

TODO
----
- implement erlang tcp server (for single connection)
- use shell script as a client
- implement simple c++ client
- make them talk
- use piqi/protobuf 
- change implementation of server to accept create process per new client
- OTP
- distributed solution of server... (anyway, i will never reach this point ;-) )
